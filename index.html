   Change in the Game(1920-39)by the 1920, the scoring rules had changed so that touchdowns were six points
   and field goals were three. Players in the 1920s and 1930s were wearing helmets and padding in their uniforms 
   Helmets were made of leather with flaps that came down over the ears, and padding was hard leather. The next three
   decades were created in large part to make the game safer and more fan friendly in 1943 helemts became mandatoy.By
   1955 most of the league was wearing face masks.In 1974 the goalposts were moved back from the goal line to the end line 
   Wgere they've stayed ever since. Kickoffs move from the 40 to 35 yard line. A 1978 defenders player can only make contact 
   with a receiver to the point of five yards beyond the line of scrimmage. In 1994 kickoffs were moved September 4, 1994 the
   tow point conversion in NFl history. In the 2010 playoffs the league installed a modified sudden-death overtime systme to help 
   determin a winner in a tie game, two years later the league expanded those rules to cover all regular season games. The current 
   rules give receives scores a touchdown on its first possession. In 2017 the league approved shortening overtime in the regular
   season to 10 minutes from 15. Also the ball would be placed at the 25 rather than a 20 yard line after follwing a touchback.
